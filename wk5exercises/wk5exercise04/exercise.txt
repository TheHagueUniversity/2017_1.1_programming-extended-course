We are extending the clock with the current day and month. There are two extra span elements edited to do this. Please change the code in a way that it shows the time in #time and the day in #date. The stlying is taken care of.

Write your own seperate function to get the current month and display the current month in text. You may use the following array:

var months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December'];

The month must be printed as for example; "22 April" in the correct span.
