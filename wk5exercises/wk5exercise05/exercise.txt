We are going to calculate the how many days you are studying. First get the current date and add the start date of your school year, e.g. 22-08-2016. 

Calculate difference and get a positive number using the Math.abs function. 

Please also use the Math.round function for nice rounded days. 

Then render days in the #days span.

Hint:
1 day in milliseconds -> hours * minutes * seconds * milliseconds.
