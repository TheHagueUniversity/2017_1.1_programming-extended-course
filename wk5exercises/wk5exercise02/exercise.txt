We are extending our own JavaScript clock. The second step is to display the current time in 24-hour notation with the column in between the hours and minutes and seconds (e.g. 15:31:01). 

Create a seperate function that returns an associative array with named indexes. Each index contains the respective time; hours and minutes and seconds. You need to add the missing leading zeros when the integers are less then the value 10. 

We will extend this function in the next exercise.
