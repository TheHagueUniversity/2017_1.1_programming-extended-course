We are going to add some extra effects on the buttons. Create two variables that contain the enter and out animations. 

The MOUSEENTER effect is:
marginLeft: 20, color: '#33AA33', ease: Elastic.easeOut.config(1, 0.3)

The MOUSEOUT effect is:
marginLeft: 0, color: '#FFFFFF', ease: Bounce.easeOut

Both last for 0.5 seconds.

The get all the elements by their class name and bind the onmouseenter and onmouseout events to the to functions.
