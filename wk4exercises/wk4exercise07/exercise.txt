Loop through all the 8 letters.

Make a reusable function the can explode one letter at a time called "explodeLetter". The function used the current number in the loop as a parameter. 

Use "explode0" plus the current number to target the class of a letter.

After 1 second the letter explode with a rotation of -360 ease Power2.EaseOut and 6x scaling, becoming the color red.
