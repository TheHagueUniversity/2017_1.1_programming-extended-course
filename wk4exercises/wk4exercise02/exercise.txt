Create an paralax cloud animation using the TweenMax library. The clouds have to be part of a shared timeline. The clouds div with the lowest z-index has to move slower behind the other cloud layer. Please use the most linear easing function.

First make the clouds appear by changing the opacity value in 1 second. 
The div with the class name "layer-1" has to move to a background-x position of 2400 in 200 seconds. 
The div with the class name "layer-2" has to move to a background-x position of 1200 in 300 seconds.
