			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				The X-Men is an American superhero film series based on the fictional superhero team of the same name, who originally appeared in a series of comic books created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and published by Marvel Comics. 20th Century Fox obtained the film rights to the characters in 1994, and after numerous drafts, Bryan Singer was hired to direct X-Men (2000) and its sequel, X2 (2003), while Brett Ratner directed X-Men: The Last Stand (2006).

				After each film earned higher box office grosses than its predecessor, several spin-off films were released, including a trilogy based on the character of Wolverine: X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), The Wolverine (2013) and Logan (2017). A prequel, X-Men: First Class, was released in 2011, followed by X-Men: Days of Future Past, a sequel to both X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men: First Class, in 2014 and X-Men: Apocalypse in 2016. In February 2016, a spin-off focusing on Deadpool was released and became the highest-grossing film of the series.
