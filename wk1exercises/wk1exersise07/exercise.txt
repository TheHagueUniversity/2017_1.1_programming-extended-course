Use the template you made for this exercise. In the JavaScript file, make three new variables named number1, number2 and result.
Assign the value 16 to the variable number1 and the value 5 to the variable number2. 

Now assign the value of number1 modulo number2 to the variable result. Use the percentage-sign (%) for modulus.

Finally create an alert box that shows the value of the variable result and run the code in the browser to check if it works. The correct answer is 1.



<< explanation >>
The modulus is an arithmetic operator you might not have seen before. It’s meaning is: remainder after division. So if I would divide 16 by 5 the answer would be 3 with a remainder of one.
Or a metaphoric way of thinking about it is using candy’s. What if I had 16 pieces of rock-hard candy. And I had to divide those among 5 children equally. Each child would get 3 pieces of candy. And I would be left with one piece.
