Use the template you made in the previous exercise for this exercise. In the JavaScript file, make three new variables named number1, number2 and result.
Assign number values to the variable number1 and number2. You can choose the value yourself. 
number1 and number2 will de added to each other and assigned to variable result. use the plus-sign (+) for addition.
Finally create an alert box that shows the value of the variable result and run the code in the browser to check if it works.

Once this works, change the code to work with the arithmetic operators: subtract (-), multiply (*) and division (/).
