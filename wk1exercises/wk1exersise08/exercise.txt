Use the template you made for this exercise. In the JavaScript file, make two new variables named firstName and age and assign your name and age as their value.

Create an alert box that shows the message “My name is x and I am y years old” where x and y are substituted with the value of the variables firstName and age. Use the plus-sign (+) to combine the texts and values.
