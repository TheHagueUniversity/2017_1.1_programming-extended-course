We are going to get the local The Hague weather using the openweathermap.org API. Please create your own API key first. 

Because the API request in Asyncronous and can fail we need to add a error functionality that hides the container if the request is not done.

Please use the following function names to create a solid structure within your code.

makeRequest
responseMethod
updateUISuccess
updateUIError

The HTML and CSS are already in place.
